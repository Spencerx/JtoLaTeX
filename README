This is JtoLaTeX, a compiler which writes LaTeX files using J evaluation
for the hard bits.

This project aims to be extensible, and to interface well with J.
A natural corollary of this behavior will be a particularly powerful
formatting language.

The script jlatex can be run on a document, and will compile it to a
.tex document and then run pdflatex on that.

Documents can be written entirely in LaTeX. JtoLaTeX provides the
following additional functionality:
  A section enclosed in \J() will be executed as J to make a LaTeX math
    mode display.
  A section enclosed in \j() will form a LaTeX inline math mode section.

Examples of code written for LaTeX mode in J can be found at
http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/MarshallLochbaum/J%20to%20LaTeX.

Functionality can be added easily in the opdata.ijs (convert native J
operations to LaTeX) and funcs.ijs (Utilities for JtoLaTeX code) scripts.

This version includes hard-coded filepaths in jlatex, and a path to the
current folder at the top of jlatex.ijs.
