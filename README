This is JtoLaTeX, a compiler which writes LaTeX files using J evaluation
for the hard bits.

This project aims to be extensible, and to interface well with J.
A natural corollary of this behavior will be a particularly powerful
formatting language.

The script jlatex can be run on a document, and will compile it to a
.tex document and then run pdflatex on that.

Documents are written in LaTeX, except that a section enclosed in
\J() will execute as a J snippet, using the J function latex.

See doc/introduction for some (not very extensive) guidance and examples
of JtoLaTeX code.

Functionality can be added easily in the opdata.ijs (convert native J
operations to LaTeX) and funcs.ijs (Utilities for JtoLaTeX code) scripts.

This version includes hard-coded filepaths in jlatex, and a path to the
current folder at the top of jlatex.ijs.
